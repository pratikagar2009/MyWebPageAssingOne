                    <p>A pilot reports a strange haze enveloping his plane, then disappears; eleven hours after fuel starvation,
                        as if calling from a void, he is heard 600 miles away. He requests permission to land, then vanishes
                        forever. A freighter steaming over placid seas disappears without a trace. A pleasure yacht ghosts
                        past without a soul on board. A pilot calls for help because a "weird object" is harassing his plane.
                        A jet collides with an "unknown" and is never found. . . .</p>

                    <h2>Da Vinci Code </h2>
                    <p>The Da Vinci Code provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Mary
                        Magdalene's role in the history of Christianity. The book has, however, been extensively denounced
                        by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church, and consistently criticized
                        for its historical and scientific inaccuracies.
